A port of the popular Vim theme Zenburn for Emacs 24, built on top
of the new built-in theme support in Emacs 24. There exists one
other version of the theme by Daniel Brockman. My version was
originally based on it, but it was in such a disarray, that I
decided to rewrite it from scratch in a more maintainable manner
(hopefully).

Installation:

Drop the theme in a folder that is on `custom-theme-load-path' and
enjoy!

Don't forget that the theme requires Emacs 24.
